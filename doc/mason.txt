INTRODUCTION                                              *mason-introduction*

`mason.nvim` is a Neovim plugin that allows you to easily manage external
editor tooling such as LSP servers, DAP servers, linters, and formatters
through a single interface. It runs everywhere Neovim runs (across Linux,
macOS, Windows, etc.), with only a small set of external requirements needed.

Packages are installed in Neovim's data directory (`:h standard-path`) by
default. Executables are linked to a single `bin/` directory, which
`mason.nvim` will add to Neovim's PATH during setup, allowing seamless access
from Neovim builtins (shell, terminal, etc.) as well as other 3rd party
plugins.

MASON.NVIM LUA API
                                                         *mason-api-reference*
Mason offers a public Lua API that allows you to further customize or
extend Mason. You may find documentation for it in the link below.

https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim/blob/main/doc/reference.md

Note ~
    APIs not listed in the document are not considered public and are subject
    to unannounced breaking changes.

EXTENSION PLUGINS
                                                            *mason-extensions*
Extension plugins help fill gaps with the rest of the Neovim ecosystem.

mason-lspconfig ~
    `mason-lspconfig` bridges Mason with the `lspconfig` plugin - making
    it easier to use both plugins together.

REQUIREMENTS                                              *mason-requirements*

`mason.nvim` relaxes the minimum requirements by attempting multiple different
utilities (for example, `wget`, `curl`, and `Invoke-WebRequest` are all
perfect substitutes). The _minimum_ recommended requirements are:

-   neovim `>= 0.7.0`
-   For Unix systems: `git(1)`, `curl(1)` or `wget(1)`, `unzip(1)`, `tar(1)`,
    `gzip(1)`
-   For Windows systems: pwsh or powershell, git, tar, and 7zip or peazip or
    archiver or winzip or WinRAR

Note that Mason will regularly shell out to external package managers,
such as `cargo` and `npm`. Depending on your personal usage, some of these
will also need to be installed. Refer to `:checkhealth mason` for a full list.

==============================================================================
QUICK START                                                 *mason-quickstart*

-----------------
SETTING UP MASON.NVIM

First you'll need to set up Mason. This is done by calling the `setup()`
function:
>lua
    require("mason").setup()
<
Mason will do the following during setup:
    1) enhance the Neovim session's PATH environment
    2) register commands (|mason-commands|)

Refer to |mason-settings| for all available settings.

-----------------
INSTALLING PACKAGES

Install a package via |:MasonInstall|, for example:
>vim
    :MasonInstall stylua
<
You may also install multiple packages at a time:
>vim
    :MasonInstall stylua lua-language-server
<
To install a specific version of a package, you may provide it as part of the
package name, like so:
>vim
    :MasonInstall rust-analyzer@nightly
<
Please refer to each package's own release pages to find which versions are
available.

You may also install packages in headless mode. This will run the command in
blocking mode and the command won't yield back until all packages have
finished installing:
>sh
    $ nvim --headless -c "MasonInstall lua-language-server rust-analyzer" -c qall
<
Note: ~
    You may also use the Lua API |mason-api-reference| to programmatically
    manage package installations. Through this interface you will also gain
    access to more features to allow further customization.

-----------------
THE MASON WINDOW

To view the UI for mason, run: >vim
    :Mason
<

Through this UI you may explore which packages that are available, see which
installed packages have new versions available, install, uninstall, or update
packages, expand package information, and more. The UI comes with a set of
keybinds which you may find in the help view by pressing `g?` when the Mason
window is open.

==============================================================================
REGISTRIES                                                  *mason-registries*

`mason.nvim` sources package definitions from the registries it has been
configured with (see |mason-settings|). `mason.nvim` uses the core registry,
governed by `mason.nvim`, by default. This may be extended, or even entirely
overridden, through additional registries, like so:

>lua
    require("mason").setup {
        registries = {
            "lua:my-registry",
            "github:mason-org/mason-registry",
        },
    }
<

Packages are loaded from registries in the order they've been configured,
with registries appearing first in the list having precedence.

==============================================================================
HOW TO INSTALL PACKAGES                        *mason-how-to-install-packages*

You may install packages either via the command interface or via Mason's Lua
APIs. See |:MasonInstall| or |mason-api-reference| for more details.

==============================================================================
HOW TO USE PACKAGES                                *mason-how-to-use-packages*

Although many packages are perfectly usable out of the box through Neovim
builtins, it is recommended to use other 3rd party plugins to further
integrate these. The following plugins are recommended:

-   LSP: `lspconfig` & `mason-lspconfig.nvim`
-   DAP: `nvim-dap` & `nvim-dap-ui`
-   Linters: `null-ls.nvim` or `nvim-lint`
-   Formatters: `null-ls.nvim` or `formatter.nvim`

DOWNLOAD MIRRORS                                      *mason-download-mirrors*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GITHUB MIRROR                                   *mason-download-mirror-github*

    It's possible to customize the download URL used when downloading assets
    from GitHub releases by setting the `github.download_url_template`
    settings during setup, like so:
>lua
    require("mason").setup {
        github = {
            -- The template URL to use when downloading assets from GitHub.
            -- The placeholders are the following (in order):
            -- 1. The repository (e.g. "rust-lang/rust-analyzer")
            -- 2. The release version (e.g. "v0.3.0")
            -- 3. The asset name (e.g. "rust-analyzer-v0.3.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz")

INSTALLATION ERRORS                                             *mason-errors*

                                                       *mason-provider-errors*
By default, Mason uses the api.mason-registry.dev API to resolve package
metadata. Calling this service may result in network errors on some networks
(e.g., SSL issues on corporate VPNs). If resolving the SSL error is not an
option, you will have to change the provider implementation. Mason provides a
client provider which calls underlying 3rd party service APIs directly, which
you can enable like so:
>lua
    require("mason").setup {
        providers = {
            "mason.providers.client",
            "mason.providers.registry-api",
        }
    }
<
    Note: ~
        The client provider have less overall coverage and may come with
        additional performance penalties (spawning slow commands, network &
        parsing overheads, etc.).

==============================================================================
DEBUGGING                                                    *mason-debugging*

To help with debugging issues with installing/uninstalling packages, please
make sure to set mason's log level to DEBUG or TRACE, like so:
>lua
    require("mason").setup {
        log_level = vim.log.levels.DEBUG
    }
<
You may find the logs by entering the command `:MasonLog`. Providing the
contents of this file when reporting an issue will help tremendously. Remember
to redo whatever is failing after changing the log level in order to capture
new log entries.

Lua module: mason

                                                               *mason.setup()*
setup({config})
    Sets up mason with the provided {config} (see |mason-settings|).

==============================================================================
Lua module: mason-registry

                                               *mason-registry.is_installed()*
is_installed({package_name})
    Checks whether the provided package name is installed. In many situations,
    this is a more efficient option than the Package:is_installed() method due
    to a smaller amount of modules required to load.

    Parameters:
        {package_name} - string

    Returns:
        boolean

                                                *mason-registry.get_package()*
get_package({package_name})
    Returns an instance of the Package class if the provided package name
    exists.

    This function errors if a package cannot be found.

    Parameters:
        {package_name} - string

    Returns:
        Package

                                                *mason-registry.has_package()*
has_package({package_name})
    Returns true if the provided package_name can be found in the registry.

    Parameters:
        {package_name} - string

    Returns:
        boolean

                                     *mason-registry.get_installed_packages()*
get_installed_packages()
    Returns all installed package instances. This is a slower function that
    loads more modules.

    Returns:
        Package[]

                                *mason-registry.get_installed_package_names()*
get_installed_package_names()
    Returns all installed package names. This is a fast function that doesn't
    load any extra modules.

    Returns:
        string[]

                                           *mason-registry.get_all_packages()*
get_all_packages()
    Returns all package instances. This is a slower function that loads more
    modules.

    Returns:
        Package[]

                                      *mason-registry.get_all_package_names()*
get_all_package_names()
    Returns all package names. This is a faster function than
    |mason-registry.get_all_packages()| because it loads fewer modules.

    Returns:
        string[]

                                      *mason-registry.get_all_package_specs()*
get_all_package_specs()
    Returns all package specifications. This is a faster function than
    |mason-registry.get_all_packages()| because it loads fewer modules.

    Returns:
        (PackageSpec | RegistryPackageSpec)[]

                                                     *mason-registry.update()*
update({callback})
    Updates all managed registries.

    Parameters:
        {callback} - Callback of the signature `fun(success: boolean, updated_registries: RegistrySource[])`

                                                    *mason-registry.refresh()*
refresh({callback?})
    Refreshes all registries if needed. This is a convenience wrapper around
    |mason-registry.update()| that only updates registries if:
        1) registries haven't been updated in a while
        2) or, one or more registries are not installed

    Runs in a blocking fashion if no {callback} is provided. Note that when
    running in blocking fashion the entire editor is frozen, so prefer the
    asynchronous variant unless absolutely needed.

    Parameters:
        {callback?} (optional) - Invoked when the registry has been refreshed.

    Example:
>lua
        local registry = require("mason-registry")

        -- 1. synchronous
        registry.refresh()
        local packages = registry.get_all_packages()
        ...

        -- 2. asynchronous
        registry.refresh(function ()
            local packages = registry.get_all_packages()
            ...
        end)
